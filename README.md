grokking-algorithms
--------------------
Code samples that go along with the book _Grokking Algorithms_ by Aditya Y. Bhargava.  

There may be some articles coming soon. Samples are written with .NET Core 3.1 in C# and F#. These are all console applications (for now), so they should run cross-platform.
